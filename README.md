# OpenRED

An open-source decomp/recreation of Guilty Gear -Strive-'s battle system. This project does not aim to be binary equivalent, or even a complete recreation. Rather, this project may take liberties when necessary, though the core logic should be as close as possible.

Requires Unreal Engine 5.3 Preview from the Epic Games launcher.
